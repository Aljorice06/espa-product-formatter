## ESPA-PRODUCT_FORMATTER Version 1.7.0 Release Notes
Release Date: May 2016

The product formatter project contains libraries and tools for working with the ESPA internal file format (raw binary with an XML metadata file). It currently supports Landsat 4-8.

This project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. For questions regarding this source code, please contact the Landsat Contact Us page and specify USGS CDR/ECV in the "Regarding" section. https://landsat.usgs.gov/contactus.php

  * GeoTIFF libraries (1.2.5 or most current) -- ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/geotiff/libgeotiff/

  * Land/water static polygon -- http://espa.cr.usgs.gov/downloads/auxiliaries/land_water_poly/land_no_buf.ply.gz

NOTE: The HDF-EOS2 link currently provides the source for the HDF4, JPEG, and ZLIB libraries in addition to the HDF-EOS2 library.

### Installation
  * Install dependent libraries - HDF-EOS GCTP (from HDF-EOS2), HDF4, HDF-EOS2, TIFF, GeoTIFF, JPEG, XML2, JBIG, and ZLIB.

  * Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.  Note: If the HDF library was configured and built with szip support, then the user will also need to add an environment variable for SZIP include (SZIPINC) and library (SZIPLIB) files.
  ```
    export HDFEOS_GCTPINC="path_to_HDF-EOS_GCTP_include_files"
    export HDFEOS_GCTPLIB="path_to_HDF-EOS_GCTP_libraries"
    export TIFFINC="path_to_TIFF_include_files"
    export TIFFLIB="path_to_TIFF_libraries"
    export GEOTIFF_INC="path_to_GEOTIFF_include_files"
    export GEOTIFF_LIB="path_to_GEOTIFF_libraries"
    export HDFINC="path_to_HDF4_include_files"
    export HDFLIB="path_to_HDF4_libraries"
    export HDFEOS_INC="path_to_HDFEOS2_include_files"
    export HDFEOS_LIB="path_to_HDFEOS2_libraries"
    export JPEGINC="path_to_JPEG_include_files"
    export JPEGLIB="path_to_JPEG_libraries"
    export XML2INC="path_to_XML2_include_files"
    export XML2LIB="path_to_XML2_libraries"
    export JBIGINC="path_to_JBIG_include_files"
    export JBIGLIB="path_to_JBIG_libraries"
    export ZLIBINC="path_to_ZLIB_include_files"
    export ZLIBLIB="path_to_ZLIB_libraries"    
    export ESPAINC="path_to_format_converter_raw_binary_include_directory"
    export ESPALIB="path_to_format_converter_raw_binary_lib_directory"
  ```
  Define $PREFIX to point to the directory in which you want the executables, static data, etc. to be installed.
  ```
    export PREFIX="path_to_directory_for_format_converter_build_data"
   ```

  * Download the static land/water polygon from http://espa.cr.usgs.gov/downloads/auxiliaries/land_water_poly/land_no_buf.ply.gz. Unzip the file into $PREFIX/static_data.  Define the ESPA_LAND_MASS_POLYGON environment variable to point to the $PREFIX/static_data/land_no_buf.ply file in order to run the land/water mask code.
  ```
    export ESPA_LAND_MASS_POLYGON=$PREFIX/static_data/land_no_buf.ply
  ```
  
* Install ESPA product formatter libraries and tools by downloading the source from Downloads above.  Goto the src/raw\_binary directory and build the source code there. ESPAINC and ESPALIB above refer to the include and lib directories created by building this source code using make followed by make install. The ESPA raw binary conversion tools will be located in the $PREFIX/bin directory.

  Note: if the HDF library was configured and built with szip support, then the user will also need to add "-L$(SZIPLIB) -lsz" at the end of the library defines in the Makefiles.  The user should also add "-I$(SZIPINC)" to the include directory defines in the Makefile.

  Note: on some platforms, the JBIG library may be needed for the XML library support, if it isn't already installed.  If so, then the JBIGLIB environment variable needs to point to the location of the JBIG library.

### Linking these libraries for other applications
The following is an example of how to link these libraries into your
source code. Depending on your needs, some of these libraries may not
be needed for your application or other espa product formatter libraries may need to be added.
```
 -L$(ESPALIB) -l_espa_format_conversion -l_espa_raw_binary -l_espa_common \
 -L$(XML2LIB) -lxml2 \
 -L$(HDFEOS_LIB) -lhdfeos -L$(HDFEOS_GCTPLIB) -lGctp \
 -L$(HDFLIB) -lmfhdf -ldf -L$(JPEGLIB) -ljpeg -L$(JBIGLIB) -ljbig \
 -L$(ZLIBLIB) -lz -lm
```

## Release Notes
  * Updated the LOCAL_ESPA_SCHEMA define to point to espa-product-formatter vs.
    the outdated espa-common name.
  * Modified the schema to allow the 'source' for the bands to be a generic
    text vs. a specified list of options.
  * Confirmed the L1T filenames are supported for both the legacy L1T filenames
    as well as the new Landsat Collection filenames.
